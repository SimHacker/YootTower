Alan Kay joined Atari after leaving Xerox PARC, attracted by its potential to impact the educational sector through innovative uses of technology.

### [Burroughs Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burroughs_Corporation)
Mentioned by Alan Kay as the workplace of Bob Barton, who influenced early computing with the development of stack machines.
These machines were crucial in the evolution of computing due to their ease of compiling high-level language code.

### [Data General](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_General)
Data General is noted for its development of the Nova, a series of minicomputers that were among the first to offer powerful computing capabilities at a lower cost.
The Nova's design influenced Alan Kay's development work at Xerox PARC and was considered for acceleration in computing capabilities.

### [MACWORLD Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macworld/iWorld)
MACWORLD Japan, a magazine focused on Apple products and technology, hosted the interview between Yoot Saito and Alan Kay.
The special issue was intended to celebrate significant milestones in computing, particularly reflecting on the history and future of technologies like the Macintosh.

### [MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology)
MIT is where Ivan Sutherland developed Sketchpad, an early graphical interface that influenced subsequent generations of graphical computing research.
MIT's environment fostered significant technological innovations that contributed broadly to the field of computing.

### [National Institutes of Health (NIH)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institutes_of_Health)
The NIH funded part of Wes Clark's work on the LINC machine, one of the earliest personal computers, which was designed to meet the needs of biomedical research.
This support highlights the NIH's role in fostering technological innovation that intersects with public health research.

### [National Science Foundation (NSF)](https://whatishappening.org/alan-kay-vpri-nov-2012/#:~:text=Government%20Agencies%20and%20Vacuum%20Tube%20Computers)
The National Science Foundation (NSF) was instrumental in supporting the foundational research and development that led to major advances in early computing and the internet, particularly influencing pioneers like Alan Kay.
Established in the 1950s, the NSF, along with the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), provided critical funding to institutions such as MIT, Carnegie Mellon, and the University of Utah—where innovators like Kay were educated and began their groundbreaking work.
This investment was crucial for the development of fields such as computer graphics, network systems, and object-oriented programming.
Kay's subsequent work at Xerox PARC, including the creation of the Smalltalk programming language and the Dynabook concept, was profoundly shaped by the innovative environments fostered by NSF and ARPA’s funding, highlighting their significant role in advancing the frontiers of science and technology.

### [SRI International (Stanford Research Institute)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRI_International)
SRI International, originally Stanford Research Institute, is a pivotal nonprofit scientific research institute based in Menlo Park, California.
Founded in 1946, SRI is notable for its development of groundbreaking technologies, including the computer mouse and the oN-Line System (NLS), engineered under Douglas Engelbart’s leadership.
These innovations laid foundational work for interactive computing, significantly influencing the development of personal computing and user interface design.
SRI's pioneering work, particularly Engelbart's contributions, resonated through Alan Kay's philosophies and the design principles of Xerox PARC, shaping modern computing interfaces and personal computers.

### [Xerox PARC (Palo Alto Research Center)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PARC_(company))
The Palo Alto Research Center (PARC), originally part of Xerox and now operated by SRI International, played a pivotal role in the development of personal computing and graphical user interfaces.
Founded in 1970, PARC became a breeding ground for revolutionary technologies such as the computer mouse, developed from Douglas Engelbart's earlier innovations at SRI.
This technology, along with the development of the desktop metaphor and graphical user interface (GUI), were integral to the creation of the Xerox Alto.
These innovations profoundly influenced Alan Kay's work on user interface design and the development of object-oriented programming at Xerox PARC, which in turn impacted the broader tech industry and shaped modern computing.

### [Xerox Data Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_Data_Systems)
Xerox Data Systems (XDS) was a division of Xerox aimed at penetrating the computer business during a critical period when computing technology was rapidly evolving.
Established after Xerox's acquisition of Scientific Data Systems in 1969, XDS sought to make inroads into the mainframe and computer markets, positioning itself alongside the innovative environment of Xerox PARC.
However, XDS represented the broader corporate ambitions of Xerox to expand into computing beyond the pioneering graphical user interface and personal computing developments at PARC.
This division highlighted Xerox's strategic attempts to capture a significant share of the burgeoning computer industry, reflecting the company's broader corporate ambitions during a transformative era in technology.
