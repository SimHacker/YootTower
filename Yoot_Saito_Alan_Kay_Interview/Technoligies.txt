Smalltalk-72
Developed at Xerox PARC, Smalltalk-72 was an early version of the Smalltalk programming language designed to explore object-oriented concepts and user interface design. It introduced groundbreaking ideas such as every entity being an object and using message passing for communication between objects, forming the foundation for future developments in the Smalltalk series and object-oriented programming.

ALTO
The Xerox Alto, introduced in 1973 by Xerox PARC, was a pioneering computer designed for individual use. It is considered one of the first computers to feature a graphical user interface (GUI), a mouse, and a desktop metaphor. Its development was instrumental in shaping the personal computing industry.

Constructionism
Constructionism is a learning theory developed by Seymour Papert, distinct from but building on Jean Piaget's constructivism. It posits that learners construct mental models to understand the world around them and that learning can happen most effectively when people are active in making tangible objects in the real world.

Interim Dynabook
The Interim Dynabook was an experimental portable computer developed at Xerox PARC as a precursor to the envisioned Dynabook. It aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of a personal computer for children and educational environments, influencing future portable computers.

Smalltalk-76
Smalltalk-76 was an enhanced version of Smalltalk developed at Xerox PARC. It featured significant improvements in language syntax and performance, establishing many conventions used in later versions of Smalltalk. This version solidified many object-oriented features and influenced the development of many modern programming languages.

Object-oriented Programming (OOP)
Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data, in the form of fields, and code, in the form of procedures. A feature of objects is an object's procedures that can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated. OOP languages are diverse, but the most influential ones such as Smalltalk, Java, C++, and Python have shaped software development practices around the world.

Graphical User Interface (GUI)
The graphical user interface is a form of user interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices through graphical icons and visual indicators such as secondary notation, as opposed to text-based interfaces, typed command labels or text navigation. GUIs were introduced in reaction to the perceived steep learning curve of command-line interfaces, which require commands to be typed on the keyboard.

Metaclass
In object-oriented programming, a metaclass is a class of a class. A metaclass defines the behavior and operations of classes, which are themselves instances of their metaclass. This concept is used extensively in Smalltalk and Python to allow more dynamic and flexible behaviors in software design.

Actor Model
The Actor model in computer science is a mathematical model of concurrent computation that treats "actors" as the universal primitives of concurrent computation. In response to a message that it receives, an actor can make local decisions, create more actors, send more messages, and determine how to respond to the next message received. It was formalized by Carl Hewitt in 1973 and influenced the development of later concurrent languages.

Object-Oriented Zoned Environment (OOZE)
OOZE was an innovative virtual memory management system used in Smalltalk-76 at Xerox PARC. Designed to optimize object storage by enabling efficient swapping of objects between memory and disk, OOZE allowed Smalltalk to manage a large number of objects effectively, contributing to the feasibility of more complex object-oriented applications.

NoteTaker
Developed at Xerox PARC, the NoteTaker was an early portable computer prototype that aimed to implement the ideas of the Dynabook in a more practical form. Although only a few units were built, the NoteTaker featured a built-in display and a keyboard in a briefcase-sized enclosure, pushing forward the concept of portable computing.

Bytecode
Bytecode is a form of instruction set designed for efficient execution by a software interpreter. In the context of Smalltalk-76, bytecode was used to improve the performance and portability of the language across different hardware platforms. Each Smalltalk operation was compiled into a sequence of bytecodes, which were then interpreted by the Smalltalk virtual machine.

Metaclasses in Smalltalk
In Smalltalk, metaclasses are classes whose instances are classes themselves. This reflective feature allows Smalltalk and other languages like Python to have extremely dynamic features, where classes themselves can be modified at runtime. Metaclasses are central to the flexibility and expressiveness of Smalltalk's object-oriented model.

Dynabook
The Dynabook was a conceptual portable personal computer for education, formulated in the late 1960s and early 1970s by Alan Kay at Xerox PARC. This concept has heavily influenced the design and development of devices geared towards human-computer interaction and is seen as a precursor to the laptop computer.

Simula
Simula is considered the first object-oriented programming language. Developed in the 1960s by Kristen Nygaard and Ole-Johan Dahl in Norway, Simula introduced the concept of classes, objects, and inheritance. It directly influenced the development of Smalltalk and many other object-oriented languages that followed.

Inheritance (OOP)
In object-oriented programming, inheritance is a mechanism where new classes derive properties and behaviors (methods) from existing classes. This provides a method for creating a new class using the behavior of an existing class. The concept, integral to OOP, allows for code reusability and the creation of more complex software systems.

Xerox Star
The Xerox Star was a commercial product derived from the research at Xerox PARC, specifically from the development of the Alto and the learning from Smalltalk environments. Introduced in 1981, it was one of the first computers to use a graphical user interface extensively, aiming at improving user-friendliness and accessibility for office tasks.

Message Passing (OOP)
In object-oriented programming, message passing involves sending a message to an object to request that it invoke one of its methods. This concept is fundamental to Smalltalk and has been influential in many other programming languages that emphasize encapsulation and interaction through objects.

LISP
LISP, developed by John McCarthy in the late 1950s, is one of the earliest programming languages. It features a fully parenthesized prefix notation and has been influential in the development of the theory of computation and artificial intelligence. LISP's focus on recursion and its unique approach to code-as-data (homoiconicity) influenced the development of many programming concepts and languages, including Smalltalk.
