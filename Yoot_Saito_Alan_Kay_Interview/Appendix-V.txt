APPENDIX V: SMALLTALK-76 INTERNAL STRUCTURES
This shows how Smalltalk-76 was implemented. In the center, between "static" and "dynamic" lies a byte-com-piled method of Class Rectangle. Slightly above it is the source text string written by the programmer. The method tests to see whether a point is contained in the rectangle. In the dynamic part, the program counter is just starting to execute the first less-than. This general scheme goes all the way back to the B5000 and the FLEX machine, but is considerably more refined.
