## Interview Context and Overview

### Introduction to the Special Issue

**Yoot Saito:** MACWORLD Japan, special issue.
Special means the ten year anniversary of Macintosh or something.

**Alan Kay:** That's right, next year.

### Purpose of the Interview
**Yoot Saito:** Next year January, we would like to put Mr. Engelbart's interviews for a special issue for the computer itself.
So in this interview, I would like to ask you for past things, not only the future but past things, perspective so...

**Alan Kay:** Sure.

## Early Career and Education

### Joining Apple Post-College

**Yoot Saito:** So after you graduated college, you joined Apple.

**Alan Kay:** What my college history was I went to college for two years, then I went into the Air Force for a few years, and then I came out and went for another couple of years and graduated.
Then I went to Utah.
Utah was an ARPA project.
Also, you will find we can do this interview, but you will also find a lot of material in that, because it has all of that.

### Impact of Flex Machine Project

**Yoot Saito:** Also Dr. Hubbert <?> ***[inaudible]*** writes about that in Japanese.
And at that time, maybe in 1966 or 67, you were involved in the flex machine project?

**Alan Kay:** 1966, that's right.
That started in early 1967.
It was done with Ed Cheetal.

**Yoot Saito:** He proposed the desktop computer concept right?

**Alan Kay:** Yes, you never know who was the first.
You know, I show in here Wes Clark's Link machine was maybe the first.
Ivan Sutherland, we think of that as being the first time of something like personal computing.
Here is the Link.
So that was a desk top machine as well and that was 1962.

**Yoot Saito:** The year I was born.

**Alan Kay:** Yeah, so people were thinking about personal computing very early.
Wes Clark's notion of it, he had a grant partially from the National Institute of Health, and they needed something that would be much more responsive for doing bio-medical experiments.

### Development of Early Personal Computers

**Alan Kay:** So Wes had been the designer of some fairly large, he was associated with the National Institute of Health for some bio-medical experiments.
He had been the designer of some fairly large, he was associated with the Whirlwind computer, a very famous old computer, and he was also the designer of this big computer that Ivan Sutherland used for Sketchpad, and then he decided that he would do a little computer, almost as a kit.

**Alan Kay:** That first summer in 1962 I think 20 people, master of fact that's in the book as well, 20 people that were in the biomedical sciences came out and assembled their own machines.
So the idea was that if they could put the machine together and get it running, then they could take care of it.

**Alan Kay:** Of course there wasn't any customer service back then.
Those machines were a really beautiful design, and they are certainly the first things to be like personal computing as we think of them today.

**Alan Kay:** Even one of the most interesting features on it is when you debug them, there is a variable speed control, so when you debug the machine, you could actually slow the machine down and watch it.
It was very cute.

### Conceptualization of the Desktop Computer

**Yoot Saito:** Was maybe 1966, 1967, and it was a title concept, it was not an existing computer but just raised the concept, is that right.

**Alan Kay:** Yeah, well, in what Cheetal, Cheetal had a little machine.
You could really call it a calculator.

**Alan Kay:** That he had made out of a little television set and some logic, and he wanted it to be more programmable.
He and I became good friends, so I got interested in doing a very compact language for it.

**Alan Kay:** And I had already seen Simula, and Klaus Wirth, you know, the guy who did Pascal, he had, before he did Pascal, he did one nice language, which was a language called Oiler.
Oiler was done around 1965 and was based on some work by a guy by the name of van Weingarten, which is not particularly important, but he was the guy who had the original, essentially it was to take ALGOL and try to be able to do everything that ALGOL could do without having to be without having to use as many features.

**Alan Kay:** So what it turned out to be was a language a lot like Lisp, but coming from the other direction.
So it was a very simple language, but it had the same power as ALGOL, in fact, a little more power than ALGOL.
It was very small and easy to compile.

**Alan Kay:** The other influence was a guy named Bob Barton who had done the early Burroughs stack machines.
Again, these machines were very easy to compile higher level language code.

**Alan Kay:** So I got the idea of trying to, instead of taking ALGOL and simplifying it, of taking simulants and simplifying it.
So that was what Flex was, was an attempt to take this language, which was, Simula was not quite an object language, but, it suggested a whole new way of doing computing and I tried to make it simpler.
Then we imbedded that pretty directly into the hardware of this machine.

## Xerox PARC Mission and Strategy

### Initial Mission of Xerox PARC

**Yoot Saito:** What was the first mission of PARC from Xerox people?

**Alan Kay:** Xerox, well they had a phrase, which was that Xerox should be the architects of information.
Nobody knew what that meant.

**Alan Kay:** There was also a vaguer idea which was if paper is eliminated in the office environment, Xerox should be the company to do it.
That was it.

**Alan Kay:** PARC was set up explicitly ...
Remember, Xerox was a fairly large company by the way.
PARC was a very small fraction of their R&D budget.
Their R&D budget was in the hundreds of millions of dollars and PARC I think in those early days was, I don't know, five to ten million.

**Alan Kay:** It was a very small group, and it was explicitly put in California, which is as far away from corporate headquarters as possible.
It was supposed to be a basic research place.
It was not supposed to have any specific charter.
Except it was supposed to do along these general lines.

### Research Freedom at PARC

**Alan Kay:** So there was a group of people in the physical sciences.
There were people doing colloidal chemistry.
People looking at photo conductors, people doing optics.
So these are all of the basic technologies in xerography.
And then there was us.

**Alan Kay:** Xerox, a couple of years before this, had bought themselves a computer company, and so they had a company called Xerox Data Systems, and they wanted to be in the computer business.
So they hired some computer science researchers, I think partly because they were trying to be in lots of different businesses.
But also had bought a bunch of education companies.
They bought several education publishers, and so forth.
They were making a lot of money and diversifying in many areas.

### Funding Philosophy at PARC

**Yoot Saito:** So Dr. Bob Taylor called you, and what did he say to begin with, Mr. Kay, please do this, or ...

**Alan Kay:** Oh no, it didn't work that way because ARPA had a tradition of just funding people, not projects.
So generally speaking, you, at the worst you went to them with a project.
But usually what they would do is to find bright people and just give them money.
That was it.

**Yoot Saito:** So it means whatever you like?

**Alan Kay:** Yeah.
So when I was talking to Taylor about the stuff, I said education is a big thing, Xerox is doing stuff in education, we should really, I want to do this, dynabook thing.
That was it.
We won't bother.
That happened.
That was it.

## Development of Dynabook and Networked Computing

### Introduction of Dynabook Concept

**Yoot Saito:** Then you raised your ideas by the computer media, like well, Dynabook.

**Alan Kay:** Yeah, you know, basically there were a whole bunch of things going on.
Everybody there, again you have to realize a lot of this stuff came from Xerox not knowing quite what it should do about computers, then there were ten years of ARPA research in the '60s, which is all about what people thought the destiny of computers was to be, which was to be an interactive complimentary partner.

### Networking and Distributed Computing at PARC

**Alan Kay:** So, one of the things that everybody agreed on was that things were going to be networked.
A lot of us had worked on the ARPANET.
Networking was going to be important, and more than that, distributive computing, which is a phrase I think Butler Amson made up, but distributive computing was going to be the way computing was going to be done.

**Alan Kay:** So the computers were getting cheaper.
We wanted to have them on fast networks.
We wanted to be able to share a variety of computer resources in various ways.

### Integrating Engelbart's NLS into Distributed Systems

**Alan Kay:** So one of the earliest projects at PARC, that some of the Berkeley people wanted to do, was to take Engelbart's NLS, in fact we had a joint project with Engelbart's group for a while, we wanted to take Engelbart's system and put it on t distributive computing system.
In other words, take it off the main frame and put it on a distributive minis.

**Alan Kay:** In fact, that was done, or something like that was done.
It turned out that the Alto was actually over that architecture.

**Alan Kay:** I'm just pointing out that the Alto won out over that as not an official project until it was already done.
It was kind of done for fun and in secret a little bit.

### Executive Decisions and PDP-10 Alternatives

**Yoot Saito:** So you were considered from XE, Xerox executive privilege.

**Alan Kay:** Yeah, there was, the story on that is complicated, but actually the story is put forth in some detail in there so you get a chance to see it, but basically, the computer people wanted to have a PDP-10, which was made by DEC, because everybody else in the ARPANET, the ARPA group had PDP-10's and we wanted to be compatible.
People wanted to use the Lisp which was on the PDP-10, which was done at <x> ***[inaudible]***.

**Alan Kay:** Xerox didn't want the computer people to have a PDP-10, because they were selling Sigma 7's.
And Sigma 7 didn't have a good operating system on it.

**Alan Kay:** So one of the big decisions very early on, just in the first couple of months, when Xerox wouldn't let us buy a PDP-10, there was a meeting in which it was decided that it would take about three years to do a good operating system for the Sigma 7, but they could actually build a fake PDP-10 in a year.
So they decided, we'll just build ourselves a PDP-10.
We won't bother.
That happened.

### Innovations with RAM and Mini-Computers

**Alan Kay:** That was a pivotal decision, partly because it had to be done quickly and well, because this was going against Xerox, and there was a lot of politics just to get the money for the parts then.
The other part if it is they decided to take some chances, and one of the chances that they decided to take was to not use core memory, but to try and use the new Intel RAM chips.
The 1103 RAM chips.

**Alan Kay:** So far as I know, it was the first actual computer to be made out of those RAM chips.
I know that one of the guys actually built much of Intel's test equipment for them.
Just to help them test.
So, they had some other ideas.

**Alan Kay:** They decided to use a little mini-computer to actually run this time sharing computer.
So there was one computer running another computer and they made it fault tolerant and a bunch of other things, and they did it quickly.

**Alan Kay:** So the result of it was, not only did we have a fake PDP-10, the thing was the most reliable PDP-10 ever made, but we learned a lot about this new solid state RAM.
And when it came time to do the Alto, this technology was already understood and we had a lot of it.

## Alto Development and Applications

### Rapid Development of the Alto

**Yoot Saito:** Of the prototype.

**Alan Kay:** Yeah, but he was also the main architect of the PDP-10.

**Yoot Saito:** I have a question that I suspect you mean the PARC people decided to develop the Alto because they wanted computers to use, right?

**Alan Kay:** Well the actual, the way that came about is I designed a computer I call mini-com.
Mini-com was about the size of a small boom box.
It was about this big.
There is a picture in there of it.
That's it.

**Alan Kay:** It was about the summer of '71 that was designed.
This is not a dynabook, but this is an attempt to take existing technology and do something that I thought we could cover a lot of the ground that Seymour Papert had been doing.
This also is influenced by Wes Clark's Link.
More than the Flex machine.

**Alan Kay:** The Flex machine was too complicated.
I wanted to have something that was really simple.
It just took existing components, like a Sony regular 9 inch TV, and a mouse, and a keyboard folded down.
Just closed up so you could carry it.
That’s what I wanted to do.

### Funding and Building Mini-Coms

**Alan Kay:** Actually in the appendix of this thing, there is a memo that I wrote the next year saying that it is time to do this.
What happened was...
I gave a whole bunch of reasons.

**Alan Kay:** One was we needed it for the kids' stuff, and another was PARC people should have something to work on at home and so on.
Whole bunch of reasons.

**Alan Kay:** One of the executives there just absolutely turned it down, partly on the grounds that we just spent a whole bunch of time convincing Xerox that we needed this time-sharing system.
Now we were going to confuse them by doing personal computers.
So I was very very upset.

**Alan Kay:** After I finished being upset, I decided instead of making a bunch of these, I would make five machines I could do stuff with kids.
I would make them out of this character generator.
That's also described in there.

### Development of Creative Computing Tools

**Alan Kay:** In order to do the early font stuff, we decided to build a high-resolution video character generator system.
I decided I would get five more of those things built, and I would get Novas, that Data General Novas, and I would just put together five systems that I could do work on.
I had about two hundred and thirty thousand dollars or so to do this.

**Alan Kay:** That summer, we got, I was doing painting when I started working, the first painting system.
We had already done the fonts.
We got the music going.

**Alan Kay:** I did the music myself, and we got the first animation stuff going.
So we had a whole bunch of stuff going.
We could show a demo of what this thing was going to be like.

### Implementation of Smalltalk

**Yoot Saito:** Was it done by Smalltalk functions?

**Alan Kay:** No, Smalltalk didn't exist yet.
There was a design for a language called Smalltalk '71, but it wasn't implemented.
And so then, as I tell them, two things happened in September.

**Alan Kay:** One was...
Bob Taylor and Butler Lampson came over and asked me if I had any money, and I said well I have about two hundred and thirty-thousand, and they said, well, how would you like us to build your little machine for you.
I thought that would be great.

**Alan Kay:** So I gave them all this information, what the pixel size should be, and here's how fast it has to be to do animation, and the music and all this stuff, and it turned out that Thacker had a bet with another Xerox executive that you could do a significant hardware project in just a few months.

**Alan Kay:** So I forget what the terms were, but it was something that he decided that he would win the bet on this in three months.
So he decided that he would win the bet on this machine, that was part of the deal.

**Alan Kay:** Also, he was very interested in making a Nova that was ten times as fast, because he wanted to use the new ...

### Faster and More Powerful Computing

**Yoot Saito:** Nova was ten times as fast as what?

**Alan Kay:** No, a machine that was ten times as fast as a Data General Nova.

**Yoot Saito:** Nova, what is it short for?

**Alan Kay:** Data General.
It's a company that's still around.
Called Data General.

**Alan Kay:** The machines that they used to sell back then were called Novas.
These were really great.
These were the first really cheap mini-computers.
You could get them for like ten thousand dollars.
They were fast and cheap.

**Alan Kay:** Thacker thought he could build a much faster one using the new bi-polar technology, and Lamson had gotten interested in exploring, because of what silicon was going to happen.
He wanted to build what he called a five hundred dollar PDP-10.
So these three sets of desires sort of coalesced in the Alto.

### Creation of Smalltalk Language

**Yoot Saito:** The other thing that happened then was, also it's described in there, there is a conversation in the hallway about languages.
How powerful, how much work did you have to do to do a really powerful computer language, and I said, just a half a page.
Half a page is all, because Lisp itself can be described in a half page.

**Alan Kay:** So these guys in the hallway said, put up or shut up, so that's when I actually sat down and actually designed Smalltalk.
Part of the way the design worked out in order for its description, which is in here in the appendix, right here, basically I spent about a week and a half figuring out this, and that is basically all of Smalltalk in itself.
It's basically an all object oriented language written in itself.
That was all done for fun.

**Alan Kay:** What happened was I went away on a trip and came back and Dan Ingalls had gotten that working, so all of a sudden we had a programming language.
So it happened that when the Alto got done, in April of 1972, Smalltalk was working too.
It was all done very quickly, just in a few months.
People could hardly believe this today, it seems to take years.

### Independent Development by Alan Kay

**Yoot Saito:** You did it alone, by yourself?

**Alan Kay:** Yeah.
What I did was...

**[Transition to next page or continuation of thought might be needed here]**

**END SIDE A - TO SIDE B**

**Alan Kay:** ...from what I had done, they criticize.
Then the next morning I would come in at four o'clock and work until eight.
After about a week or so, this thing started looking good, so I kept on...

### The Process of Creative Computing

**Yoot Saito:** You did it on Alto?

**Alan Kay:** No, I just did it on paper.
The Alto didn't exist yet.

**Yoot Saito:** So you think something in your brain and describe...

**Alan Kay:** 
Yeah, so it was very similar to what John McCarthy did when he wrote the first Lisp interpreter just to show that you could, and a graduate student turned it into a real program.
Partly because I knew that McCarthy had done that, so I just did.
So this is kind of an example of ...
You can think of these things ...

**Alan Kay:** Did you ever study physics?
This is kind of like Newton's laws or Maxwell's equations.
When you do one of these things, it's, one of the most interesting things about computers is that you can do a universal language, just like Maxwell's equations are just four equations and it's just about all the electromagnetic radiation in the universe.

**Alan Kay:** So this is sort of an example of the application of science.
You can read about that.

### Implementation and Impact of Smalltalk

**Yoot Saito:** Yes I will.

**Alan Kay:** But it was in part because the thing was described that way that Dan Ingalls could implement it in about a month or so.
And he got a practical version going in just a couple of months, and when the Alto started working we were able to put Smalltalk on it in another month, and all of a sudden we had a system that was not just a programming system, but also active as the operating system of this machine.

## Development of the Alto Operating System

### Decentralized Software Development at PARC

**Yoot Saito:** Who did the operating system of Alto?
What was the name?

**Alan Kay:** Well on of the great ideas, and I think this was an idea that Butler Lampson had, was that we shouldn't try to make everybody, that the thing with software was everybody at Park had their own software ideas.
So Lampson's idea was let's not standardize, let's not make people work anyway, we will just standardize basically on two things.

**Alan Kay:** We will standardize on what the disk format is going to be, and the reason for that is so that we only have to write one recovery program for disk crashes.
That was a really good idea, and he actually came up with a very nice way of recovering from disk, because we knew there were going to be crashes and stuff.

**Alan Kay:** Then the other thing we would standardize on was how we were going to send stuff down the ethernet when that started working.

### Development of Ethernet at PARC

**Yoot Saito:** Ethernet was developed through these periods?

**Alan Kay:** Same period.
McCafferty ***(Who?)*** and David Boggs, and, I think it started working at the end of, the Alto started working April '73.
And the laser printer was already working by then.
Laser printer was working in '72.

**Yoot Saito:** And Ethernet?

**Alan Kay:** Ethernet was I think was working by the end of '73 or early '74.
Probably the end of '73.

**Yoot Saito:** So Ethernet was developed on Alto?

**Alan Kay:** Yes.

### Realization of Smalltalk on the Alto

**Yoot Saito:** And you described some things on paper about Smalltalk and realized on the Alto.

**Alan Kay:** Yeah.
So basically the way the Alto worked for people is you had a disk pack, a thirty disk pack, a couple of megabytes, and you shove it into the machine and there is a very simple bootstrap loader in there, but there was no operating system.
So there were three or four different operating systems.

**Alan Kay:** So Smalltalk was one of its own operating systems.
There are people who programmed in BCPL, and they had an operating system written in BCPL.

### Alto's CPU and Manufacturing Details

**Yoot Saito:** What was the CPU of the Alto?

**Alan Kay:** The CPU was, no they weren't custom, it's what they call medium scale integration.
MSI.
See you are too young.
By the time you came along they were already into large scale integration.
But back then it was MSI.

**Yoot Saito:** Who manufactured it?

**Alan Kay:** The components in it were called bit slice components, and they were made by various, so the memory was made ...
There was no custom hardware in it at all.
Just in parts.

**Yoot Saito:** So it was large, not a small one?

**Alan Kay:** Well it is interesting to think about.
In those days, just being able to use MSI, the whole Alto not counting the memory, was only 160 chips.

**Alan Kay:** So it was just two boards, two boards about this big was the Alto.
The whole theory on this machine was to not have features.
The idea was to make a machine that would run really fast, the Alto ran about six MIPS.

**Alan Kay:** So it was very fast.
It simulated what normally would have been hardware.
So whenever Thacker was working on the machine, whenever the chip count got too large, he would speed it up and throw some of them away.

## Innovations in User Interface Design

### Implementation of Bitmap Streams

**Yoot Saito:** My question is who hit on the idea of using the stream, ***[inaudible]*** stream, and block ***[inaudible]*** stream?
Papers.

**Alan Kay:** Okay, I was, the bitmap thing was my idea to use the bitmap as a string.
The white on black, the black characters on, that was something Douglas Engelbart was already doing.

**Alan Kay:** Engelbart did not have a bitmap display.
He had a very weird display which was a little line drawing display.
It was about this big.

**Alan Kay:** And the reason they went to a little one was they could make it electrostatic and you could get fairly high quality characters.
If you made them larger, you couldn't swing the beam fast enough.
The little ones are too small to look at.

**Alan Kay:** So they attached the little ones to a television camera, and they would scan the line drawing stuff and blow it up on a monitor.
What you had in your office when you were using Engelbart's system was an 875 line television monitor, with the coax going back into the machine room where the display actually was.
This thing had a rowed switch on it, so you could choose to look at it the way...

**Alan Kay:** Of course the display was painting with one dark, so you could choose to look at it that way, or you could flip the switch and reverse the video.
Everybody liked dark on white, which is reversed out.
It keeps your eyes light adapted.

**Alan Kay:** You are looking at papers on your desk and you are looking up at the screen, your eyes don't have to switch back and forth.
So the idea of having a display biased towards black on...
The Alto you could flip it either way too.

**Alan Kay:** But we people, it was slightly biased toward the black on white because we were quite sure the people would like it better.
So that idea we got pretty much from Douglas Engelbart's practice.

### Legacy of PARC's Projects

**Yoot Saito:** Can't hear ***[inaudible]***

**Alan Kay:** Yeah, that actually, we actually wanted a big two-page display, but we couldn't get everything to run fast enough to put that many bits up back then.
In fact, the right size for the Alto screen was actually this big rather than this big.

**Alan Kay:** We wound up using one display casing from the Alto was a back ***[inaudible]*** project, and the display casing from the Alto actually came from another project, and this was the project of former people from NLS.
That project was called the Polos project.
And the co-inventor of the mouse, Bill English, was at PARC.

## Innovations in Input Devices

### Engelbart's Influence on Input Devices

**Yoot Saito:** Dr. Douglas Engelbart's mouse is using the Feels <?> ***[inaudible]***.

**Alan Kay:** Yes.

### Development of Trackballs and Mice

**Yoot Saito:** And who is the idea of using bowls <?> ***[inaudible]***

**Alan Kay:** Actually, I'm not sure, but track balls were around for a long time.
One of these ball mice that is just a track ball turned upside down.
It wasn't a big idea.

**Alan Kay:** It's interesting, I think the best mouse that was ever done was the original Alto mouse, which had wheels, but it was digital.
It was very high resolution, it was like a couple of hundred transitions to the inch.
I thought things went downhill when they went to the ball mice.

### Connection of Keyboards to the Alto

**Yoot Saito:** Also you created some keyboards?

**Alan Kay:** Yes, that was from Douglas Engelbart.

**Yoot Saito:** Yes, but which can be connected to Alto, right?

**Alan Kay:** Yes.

**Yoot Saito:** And some other equipment <?> ***[inaudible]***

**Alan Kay:** Yeah, all that stuff came from this other project.
We just borrowed it, and that was why the display was actually too large in the sense that the pixels were a little bit too fat on the Alto according to the calculations we had.

## Educational Programs and Innovations

### Introduction of Educational Computing at PARC

**Alan Kay:** And after the Alto hardware is completed, you tried to do something very interesting with keys.

**Alan Kay:** Yes, we started...
We brought in Adele Goldberg and Steve Weyer to set up the program with the kids, and we started that fall, the fall of '73 when we did our first kids' stuff.

**Yoot Saito:** That is called Vivarium, right?

**Alan Kay:** No, Vivarium is the stuff I'm doing at Apple now.
That, the group was called the Learning Research Group back then.

**Alan Kay:** There are some nice movies actually of some of the very first stuff done with kids.
The Altos they are using, the displays are still in cardboard boxes.

### Impact of Computing on New Media Forms

**Yoot Saito:** Yeah, well sometimes kids can write the scores and related to the instrument, so it is my guess that you were trying to provide some environments to describe some things which could never be described before by text.
Is that right?

**Alan Kay:** Yeah, basically the idea, and this is an idea Marshall McLuhan had talked about, that every medium has its own special things that it is really good at, and you should try and find out what those are.

**Yoot Saito:** Represent the media message or something?

**Alan Kay:** Yeah.
Those are the things that you want to find out, and the things the computer is good at are dynamic things.

**Alan Kay:** Things that are in the form of systems, where you have multiple things interacting together, and so, we thought, Space War, where you have a couple of spaceships, things in orbit, animal kinds of ecologies, various kinds of games, things like amusement parks, animation, music, all of these things.

**Alan Kay:** Music has multiple voices going on top, so we are interested in, and of course object-oriented representation is very good for talking about all those.

## Early Interactive Media and Applications

### Introduction of Interactive Media at PARC

**Alan Kay:** So we just started doing stuff, we started working with the kids, and we started doing adult things.
So we brought in some adult animations in the summer of '74 to do the first system like Macromind Director ***[later Macromedia Director, Adobe Director]***.
It was called Shazam.

**Yoot Saito:** Horse and a Man.

**Alan Kay:** Horse and a Man was done by a twelve-year-old girl who added a feature to this Shazam system.

### The Role of Computers in Describing Complex Concepts

**Yoot Saito:** I think this is a very important thing for computer people, and my idea is there are a lot of things that cannot be described down, like the step of a dance or a diagram, or medical operation, a lot of things.
But it is very bureaucratic way of thinking, but most things should be described in a paper, for example, <?> ***[inaudible]*** people say that writing a paper and show me.

**Alan Kay:** I think that the main thing about description is that description should be complete in some fashion.
So for instance, there are some things in which pictures are the best there are some things where an essay is the best thing.

**Alan Kay:** So when you are talking about philosophy, where animations are the best, and there are some things where an essay is the best thing.
So when you do it with television, Television generally speaking you don't want to do with television.

**Alan Kay:** Television is not good at philosophy, because it is not good at argument.
What you do with pictures is describe, and what you do with essays is you argue.

## Counter-Culture Influences on Computing

### Counter-Culture Movement and Computing

**Yoot Saito:** Back to 1960, there was a big movement called the counter-culture, or drug culture movement.
You may know Dr. Timothy Leary for example, the concept of this movement was to expand the liberty using the kind of drugs and go over the world beyond description, for society that does not depend on the <?> or a world that does not depend on the existing religion, or images which do not depend on existing something.

**Alan Kay:** Transcendence.

**Yoot Saito:** Yeah, so the way of thinking you were trying, what you were trying to do was very similar to the counter-culture way.

**Alan Kay:** I think that the counter-culture was very heavy in Palo Alto at this time.
Some of the people at Engelbart's, ask him about it, and some of the people at PARC were very heavily into the counter-culture stuff, and there were a number of us who weren't particularly, but it still was in the air.

**Alan Kay:** I think that the radicalism just helped.
I think that it was easier to do things like what we did at Xerox PARC in California than in, to do it around MIT at that time.

**Yoot Saito:** West Coast is more heavy.

**Alan Kay:** Well I think that, for instance, right across the street from Engelbart's was the Whole Earth Catalog and Truck Store.
That was a huge counter-culture thing, and the free university was right in Palo Alto.
That was a huge counter-culture thing, people were going to psycho drama and stuff, so I think that even the people who weren't deeply into it were affected by it.

### Impact of Radical Ideas on Technological Innovation

**Yoot Saito:** Did you have a strong passion to like change the world?

**Alan Kay:** Oh sure.
Oh sure.

**Yoot Saito:** You wanted these things to go out as a product to society?

**Alan Kay:** Yes.

**Yoot Saito:** And it is a very famous story that the people did.
***[inaudible]***

**Yoot Saito:** They didn't understand it.

**Alan Kay:** Yeah, they didn't understand it.

**Yoot Saito:** Why?

**Alan Kay:** Well I think what I finally came down with...
There were various, the full story is very complicated, but the simple story is they were arguing.

**Alan Kay:** We were doing Ptolemaic astronomy and we were doing Copernican astronomy.
Ptolemy said that the sun goes around the earth, and Copernicus said, no the earth goes around the sun, with the other planets.

**Alan Kay:** So when we said the word computer, we didn't mean anything even close.
They thought of a thing with spinning disks and they really didn't have the faintest idea of what it was we were doing.

**Alan Kay:** So I think...
That's basically the simple explanation of the thing.
If they had realized what we were doing, then I don't think it would have been a problem, but what they saw when they looked at what we were doing, I have no idea.

## Transition from PARC to Atari

### Departure from Xerox PARC

**Yoot Saito:** After that you left PARC to go to Atari.

**Alan Kay:** I left PARC in 1981.

**Yoot Saito:** And before that in 1979?

**Alan Kay:** Steve was the guy from Apple.

**Yoot Saito:** Were you there at the time?

**Alan Kay:** Yes, I was in the room.

### Apple's Interest in PARC's Technologies

**Yoot Saito:** Could you tell us what kind of scene was there?

**Alan Kay:** Well, we gave a lot of demos over the years to other people, and at some point when they were starting to work on what was going to be the Lisa, some of the people at Apple, I think Steve Capps was one of them, I'm not sure exactly.
Maybe even Bill Atkinson.

**Alan Kay:** But some of the people who were at Apple had seen the stuff that we were doing and they kept on saying to Steve, you should come over and see this.
So it was a little complicated actually.

**Alan Kay:** Adele Goldberg and I did the politics for getting the Apple people in.
Adele and I stood in the back of the room, and Larry Tesler gave the demo.

**Alan Kay:** Somewhere I have a movie of a demo almost identical to the one Tesler.
I think Tesler gave part of the demo and I think Dan Ingalls gave the other part of it.
They came over more than once.

### Steve Jobs' Reaction to the Alto

**Yoot Saito:** You did not demonstrate it yourself?

**Alan Kay:** No, I didn't.
I gave lots of demos, but that particular demo, I think they had contacted Tesler.

**Yoot Saito:** Do you remember that Jobs said the first time he saw the Alto demonstration.
Were you there.

**Alan Kay:** Yeah, I was there.

**Yoot Saito:** What did he say?

**Alan Kay:** He, I think the thing, one of the things I recall from the demonstration, it is hard to remember any of it because we did so many things, but I just remember the one thing that really impressed me, I don't know if it impressed Steve or not, was I think Tesler, somebody, whoever was giving the demo at the particular time, said this stuff is all dynamically programmed.

**Alan Kay:** So one of the Apple people challenged whoever it was, I think it was Dan, no, Dan was the one who did it, but we had been, the way we did highlighting was the way it is pretty much done today, which is that was reverse video through the text, and they actually didn't like it.

**Alan Kay:** So they asked Dan whether he could change it so it would be an outline, and Dan was able to make that change in a about twenty-five seconds or so, to go into Smalltalk without stopping the machine or reloading or anything, just going in and making the change.

**Alan Kay:** That is really impressive.
Apple technical people.

### Repeated Visits and Negotiations with Apple

**Yoot Saito:** How many people were there from Apple?

**Alan Kay:** Four or five.

**Yoot Saito:** After that they came again and again.

**Alan Kay:** Yeah, it was a little complicated because Xerox was a stockholder, and I think Steve tried to actually buy the stuff.
Steve Jobs tried to get the stuff officially from Xerox, and Xerox didn't want to sell it to him either.

**Alan Kay:** And, then the next year, 1980, Larry Tesler decided to leave to go to Apple, and that was when I actually decided to take a sabbatical, because I was kind of fed up with Xerox too.

## Decision to Join Atari

### Motivations Behind Joining Atari

**Yoot Saito:** Why did you decide to go to Atari instead of other companies?
The question is why you decided to go to Atari, a game maker.

**Alan Kay:** Well, there were a couple of things.
I decided to move down here because this is where my wife is in the film business.

**Alan Kay:** I actually spent some time at a thing called the Information Sciences Institute.
I started talking to various people.

### Atari's Interest in Expanding Beyond Gaming

**Alan Kay:** The Atari thing was very interesting because it was owned by Warner, and Warner was interested in doing more than just video games, very similar to what Nintendo is today.
Atari had something like 25 million machines in people's homes, so I started thinking about doing some of this educational stuff.

**Alan Kay:** All of these electronics companies are basically publishers.
Although they are doing stuff more like paper than content, Atari was also doing content, because they do a lot of their video games, so one of the ideas was, in fact, that machine you saw in my office was one of the computers we designed for them back then to be a product.

### Sponsorship and Research Goals

**Yoot Saito:** So Atari was a kind of sponsor to your research?

**Alan Kay:** Yeah, well that's basic.
There's this joke that says the research goes on, only the sponsors change.

**Alan Kay:** The person who is a researcher, basically they are not going to do anybody else's research.
So what, when you are trying to do this stuff, you try to find a sponsor that is compatible.
They want what you want.

### Lack of Invitation from Apple

**Yoot Saito:** Was there any invitation from Apple?

**Alan Kay:** Not at that time.
Part of the thing was Apple was much smaller.

**Alan Kay:** The stuff that I do, partly because the incubation periods are so long, the company has to be of a certain size before it makes sense to hire me, and in part because I don't like to work on other people's projects.
So when you are a small company you want people who are willing to work on explicit goals.
That's not me.

**Alan Kay:** But when Apple got larger, Apple was around $900 million in '83, '84.
Steve Jobs and I started having lunch during the period I was at Atari, then in '84 he said, why don't you come over to Apple.

## Looking Back at Atari and Forward to Apple

### Reflections on Atari and Transition to Apple

**Yoot Saito:** I would like to ask you such things, but before that, let's go back to the Atari ages.
What was, you made a prototype of a personal computer with the name of Atari, so Atari wanted a personal computer for their industrial business plan?

**Alan Kay:** They didn't have an industrial business plan; basically, what we said to them was you should build something like the Mac, although the Mac wasn't there yet.
We had done, again in here, this is the last machine we did before we left Xerox.

CUT

**Yoot Saito:** So give me fifteen minutes more.
So you went to Apple and mentioned about the first Macintosh judgment and Mr. Steve Jobs was not happy about that.

**Alan Kay:** Yeah, but what could he say?

**Yoot Saito:** On the other hand, you said that the Macintosh computer was the first computer to...

**Alan Kay:** Good enough to be criticized.

**Yoot Saito:** That's very funny.
How about the Lisa?

### Reflections on the Lisa

**Alan Kay:** The Lisa was in many respects much better than the Mac.

**Yoot Saito:** That is not a computer to be criticized?

**Alan Kay:** The thing with the Lisa was, I still have a couple of them.
I used the Lisa for the first couple of years until pretty much the Mac II was...

**Alan Kay:** The Lisa was a system that had a lot of good ideas, and it had a couple of fatal compromises.
I had nothing to do with that machine.

**Alan Kay:** But basically, the right ideas it had, it had real memory protection, so that processes were protected from each other.
It had quite a number of pixels on the display.
It was programmed in an object-oriented form.

**Alan Kay:** Just lots of good, excellent ideas in it.
Then the compromises that were fatal on the thing were twofold.

**Alan Kay:** One is that for various reasons Apple wanted to always be able to sell a machine that did not require a hard disk.
Now all the PARC machines had the equivalent, they had a swapping disk on them.
It just turns out you need to be able to use the disk as a resource.

**Alan Kay:** Even the software today doesn't do much swapping, or doesn't do swapping in a very useful way.
The truth was when you had a Lisa you had to have a five megabyte disk on top.
Or somewhere else.

**Alan Kay:** The thing I think was the fatal flaw, and I don't know who made the decision, but it was not to use a fast bit slice processor like Xerox PARC had used.
Like I think one of the options was to the MD, American Micro Devices, 2901 bit slice processor.

**Alan Kay:** I think the reason they decided not to use it is they didn't think AMD would stay in business.
It's still in business.

**Alan Kay:** Somebody, who didn't know very much, liked the 68000.
They liked the 68000 I think because they had programmed PDP-11s.

**Alan Kay:** The 68000 looks kind of like a DEC architecture, when in fact it is a very bad architecture for running object oriented.
Once they decided they were going to use the Motorola architecture, they were running about a factor of five slower than they needed to run, and all of a sudden they couldn't use Smalltalk anymore.

**Alan Kay:** They had to go to Pascal.
They made an object-oriented version of Pascal.
Pascal is a static language, not a dynamic language, and all of a sudden there were things you couldn't do anymore that were easy to do in Smalltalk.

**Alan Kay:** And the thing was slower and the code was bigger.
So the Lisa had twice as much memory as this machine and didn't run as well.

### Matching Hardware to Software Needs

**Alan Kay:** The biggest problem, I think the reason why the PARC stuff worked out, is, just in PARC, because everything was kind of matched.
We did the hardware to be really fast, and the software was done to be really small.

**Alan Kay:** The software, the way you make small software is by having a lot happen on each instruction.
So you have very high-level instructions.
In order to do that in a reasonable amount of time you have to have very fast hardware.

**Alan Kay:** So the two things go together.
If you try to do high-level things on slow hardware, inadequate hardware, all of a sudden you are behind the eight ball and things don't work as well.

**Alan Kay:** Now aside from that there were many wonderful things done.
The basic thing that is thought of as the Mac user interface was done on the Lisa.

**Alan Kay:** To me, it was a vast improvement over the version of the windows interface that we had done at PARC.

### Influence of Steve Jobs on User Interface Design

**Alan Kay:** That was one of the things they did best.
I think it came out really well because Steve Jobs was intensely visual.

**Alan Kay:** He really cared about what things looked like on the screen.
He did a lot of criticism and got them to think of better ways of doing it.

**Alan Kay:** And the things that were bad about the Lisa and especially the Mac were the stuff that you don't see, like the network.
The absences of a hard disk.

**Alan Kay:** Those happen I think because Steve Jobs was not a systems person, so he didn't think of those things as being important, he just wanted to do MacDraw.
I mean MacPaint.

**Alan Kay:** That was another thing that was very unpopular when I came in, and I told them that MacDraw was the best thing that was on the Macintosh.
Steve hated MacDraw.

**Alan Kay:** He liked MacPaint because it was...
The thing is that MacDraw was the way to do it.

**Alan Kay:** If you look today what do people use, they use object-oriented graphics systems because those are the kinds of things that give you the most range.
The painting systems are sort of a secondary thing.

## Isolation and Integration in Product Design

### Steve Jobs' Vision for the Macintosh

**Yoot Saito:** Did Mr. Jobs seem to want a completed one?
Completed and isolated from other things.

**Alan Kay:** Well I don't know, I wasn't there when that was going on.
There was a concept that the Mac should be like an appliance.

**Alan Kay:** Like a toaster.
Completely self-contained machine.

**Alan Kay:** What was interesting, one of the reasons some people didn't buy the Mac was because it didn't have slots.
This was in spite of the fact that most of the things you use slots for on the IBM PC were built into the Mac.

**Alan Kay:** The network was built into the Mac and serial stuff was built into the Mac.
But the Mac didn't start selling until we made the Mac II which had slots.

### Market Perceptions of the Mac II

**Alan Kay:** The most interesting thing is that almost nobody who bought a Mac II ever put anything into the slots.
Because it was already built in there.

**Alan Kay:** It was one of these weird perception things in the buyers, they thought, well, just in case I need to put something in.
So they were willing to spend a lot more money, and these machines still get obsolete every two or three years, right.

**Alan Kay:** Actually a better thing is to buy a machine that you need and if you need another machine later on, you just buy, part of it.

**Alan Kay:** Anyway.
Who knows why people buy things.

## The Rise of the Newton and the Concept of the Dynabook

### Introduction of the Newton

**Yoot Saito:** Right.
So these years, for example Newton comes out from Apple.

**Alan Kay:** Yeah, I mainly went to Apple to try and get them to do these third paradigm things, these little machines with flat screen displays that would be tied into wireless networking.

### Potential and Realization of the Newton

**Yoot Saito:** How do you see that products?

**Alan Kay:** Well, I think that...

**Yoot Saito:** It looks a little bit closer to your drawings.

**Alan Kay:** Yeah, but remember, the Dynabook had a keyboard on it.
The reason is that even when you have really good hand-written character recognition, and actually the Newton's is quite good if you are willing to train it and be trained by it, the...

**Alan Kay:** My feeling is that, what the Newton, if you look at how...
I think the Newton was brought to market a little early.

**Alan Kay:** Because if you look at, Apple is thinking about it in the right way.
It is called the communicator and the message pad, but when they brought it to the market originally, they brought it out before the wireless paging was available.

**Alan Kay:** See, the differentiating feature of this kind of hardware is basically wireless.
It's the ability to get messages for sure, anywhere, and to start being able to send them.

**Alan Kay:** So I think the Newton came to market a couple of months early.
And I think it shouldn't be evaluated as much on the had character recognition as on the possibility of doing wireless messaging and stuff.

### The Future of the Newton as a Consumer Product

**Alan Kay:** The Newton is a whole family, because when you do a consumer product, you want to have a basic set, and the basic processor set in the Newton is very good.
It's very fast, has many possibilities, and I think that Newton is actually going to be very successful over the next few years.

### Concept of the Dynabook Revisited

**Yoot Saito:** Does it have the possibility to be a Dynabook?

**Alan Kay:** Well, Dynabook is kind of a state of mind.

**Yoot Saito:** A state of mind?

**Alan Kay:** A state of mind.
It's like looking at a comic book and wondering if you could actually put a Shakespeare play in there, or something.

**Alan Kay:** So what I am saying is a Dynabook, in the way I thought about it, particularly for children, is one that before anything else, it is a really sympathetic authoring system.
This duo we could make into a Dynabook if we had a really great authoring system for kids.

**Alan Kay:** Because the whole theory behind doing the Dynabook, which I still think is a good theory, I keep on trying it out on people, that one of the most important things about printing and learning to read and write, is not just to exchange information, but we actually wind up thinking differently by getting those skills.
People think differently in western culture after the printing press, after the renaissance, we were basically a feudal culture before the printing press came along.

**Alan Kay:** The whole structure of society was different.
People thought about their place in society as being different than afterwards.

**Alan Kay:** So printing also gives you a different point of view, being able to write things inserts you into the information stream.
So lots more people started writing opinions.

**Alan Kay:** All of those things to me are what make a Dynabook, so a Dynabook has to have a form of authoring that can be learned by a fairly young child and then get progressively stronger as the child grows older, so it actually becomes a powerful tool for them.
That, to me, is what a Dynabook is.

## Market Dynamics and the Future of Macintosh

### Evolution of Macintosh in the Market

**Yoot Saito:** Last question is how do you see the key of Macintosh has been getting in the market, and how are they go where?

**Alan Kay:** I think the difference is the Moore's law says that margins are going to decrease, so everybody who is in the hardware business, eventually the financial model for making money is essentially consumer electronics.
People make money in consumer electronics.

**Alan Kay:** Sony makes money in consumer electronics, Sanyo makes money in consumer electronics.
You can make it, but it is a different kind of business.

**Alan Kay:** The margins are very small, whereas the computer business has usually expected to have margins above fifty percent.
Right now in the desktop computer business, they are down around twenty-five or something like that, maybe less.
So, that's just going to keep on happening.

**Alan Kay:** Another way of looking at it is computer people have been making money out of paper.
They are selling stuff, and once you can automate the production of paper like in the industrial revolution, you have to make money as a publisher.

**Alan Kay:** So all of the companies, there are basically two businesses.
One is the people who want to stay in the hardware business have to go to a consumer electronics or a paper kind of margin, and you can make money that way, and the people who want to go into a higher margin will want to go into publishing.
Microsoft is in the publishing business.

### Apple as a Software Licenser

**Yoot Saito:** In a way we can say that Apple is a kind of software licenser?

**Alan Kay:** Well it should be.
Yeah, it is.
